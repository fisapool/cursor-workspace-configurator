# Early Access Program

Cursor offers an early access program that gives you early access to new and experimental features. While these features can be exciting, they may be less stable than our standard features.

Beta features are experimental and may contain bugs or unexpected behavior. We recommend staying on standard settings if you need a stable development environment.

## Joining the Early Access Program
To join the early access program and receive pre-release updates:

1. **Open Cursor Settings**
   - Access the settings menu from the Cursor application with CMD+Shift+J on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+J on Windows and Linux.

2. **Navigate to the Beta menu**
   - Find and select the Beta menu in settings sidebar.

3. **Choose the 'Early Access' option**
   - Find the ‘Update frequency’ dropdown and select ‘Early Access’ to opt in.

4. **Await the next update**
   - Wait for the next early access update to be available, and you will receive it automatically.

## Leaving the Early Access Program
If you decide you no longer want to be part of the early access program, you can opt out by toggling the ‘Update frequency’ dropdown to ‘Standard’ in the settings menu.

Then, either wait for the next update to take effect, or redownload Cursor’s latest stable release from cursor.com.

## ⚠️ Warnings
